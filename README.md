# Lunabar
## Lunabar Application
Anyone other than me still using lunabar moon tracking software? If so I just finished fixing the VoC file for moon void of course for 2019.

The file you need is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAqZELGrnYuQkAQ5mrFuwUSqzLdR5-Mg/view?usp=sharing

1.  Download the file "Void of Course.luna".
2.  In the directory where lunabar is installed (ex."...\Program Files (x86)\Lunabar") Rename the out of date "Void of Course.luna" file to "old.Void of Course.luna" 
3.  Move the new Void of Course.luna file(you just downloaded) into the directory where lunabar is installed (ex."...\Program Files (x86)\Lunabar").
4.  Restart lunabar. (good to go for another year).
